# need to supply nominal values in input file.
# make sure they are same set of nominal values
# right now nominal pressure is set from slack alone








# theory ; this is like neumanntodirichlet rather than dirichlet-to=neumann
# cannot do dirichletneumann because  then first network multi-slack, second network no slack
# understand convergence of dirichlet-neumann...can we use it to prove neumannndirichlet and specifically for this network
# does dirichletneumann work for more than 2 networks

need to rethink whether this has any relation to DNmap at all. seems more driven by hierarchical network theory rather than DN.
DN might be the case if instead of articulation points, we break up biconnected networks
